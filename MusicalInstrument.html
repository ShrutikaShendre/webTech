                    The flute is a woodwind instrument that generates sound from the flow of air through an opening. The
                    sound pitch changes as you open and close the different holes in the instrument’s body. If you are a
                    novice learner, you can start by learning beginner flutes which are usually made from silver-plated
                    brass or nickel.

                    Silver flutes are designed to generate a brighter sound while wooden flutes produce a dim sound.
                    Learning woodwind instruments is easier compared to the keyboard or string instruments. Pupils will
                    be able to master three notes within the inaugural lesson.

                    The flute is versatile and used in jazz, classical, and modern band orchestras. Playing this
                    woodwind instrument is not only relaxing, but it also enhances concentration, coordination, and
                    self-discipline.</p>
